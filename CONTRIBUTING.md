Welcome to our open source project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our community. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

Before you get started, please read through the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

# Contributing Guidelines

## Maintainer Response Times
Please be patient with the project maintainers. This project is not supported full-time and it may take some time for someone to get back to you.

## Did you find a bug?
The Cobol Sequential project uses Github Issues for tracking bugs and new development work.

To report a new Bug:
1. First review the [open issues](https://github.com/navapbc/cobol-sequential/issues) to see if someone has already encountered your issue.
2. If no one has reported this issue yet, create a new github issue, and select the bug report issue template.
3. Ensure to add as many details as you can while filing the issue. Make sure you provide steps to reproduce the issue.

## Read Before you contribute
To contribute ensure that you use Github Pull Requests from your **own** fork.

Always create [feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for your changes.

### Tests and Documentation are non-optional
Don't forget to include new tests and documentation in every code contribution. This will help reviewers  and future developers understand how your changes are meant to be used.

Contributions that just contain improved tests or documentation are always welcomed.

### Do you want to propose a significant new feature?
For large new ideas please file a new issue describing the problem you would like to solve. Please note in the issue how involved you would like to be with development.

The github issue will serve as a starting point for discussion and may lead to other architecture decisions before implementation is started.

We may change this process in the future depending on how things go.

### Questions
If you have any questions please file a github issue and try to provide as much context as you can.
